# Variant Sudoku Web (Next.js)

This is a small Next.js + TypeScript starter that mocks a backend for puzzles.

Quickstart

1. cd web
2. npm install
3. npm run dev
4. Open http://localhost:3000

Notes

- The API is mocked under `pages/api/puzzles`. Replace these endpoints with calls to your Rust backend (`/api/puzzles`) when ready.
- To deploy to Vercel, push this folder and set the project root to `web/`.
